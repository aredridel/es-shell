error exceptions now have an additional piece of information.
the second word (the one after ``error'') is now the name of
the routine which caused the error.  Thus, in the example
below, the throw command has an extra ``in'' in it.

The example at the top of the right-hand column on the fourth page
(page 56 in the Usenix proceedings) uses an obsolete version of the
fork builtin.  The in function should now be

	fn in dir cmd {
		if {~ $#dir 0} {
			throw error in 'usage: in dir cmd'
		}
		fork {		# run in a subshell
			cd $dir
			$cmd
		}
	}

The pipe timing example from the paper may not work on your system.
It depends on having a version of time(1) that understands es, either
by building it in to es or having an external time use the SHELL
environment variable.  Es will include a (minimal) time function if
it is built with USE_WAIT3; note that Solaris systems, despite their
BSD roots, seem not to support wait3().
