This is the README file for es, version 0.8

Es is an extensible shell.  The language was derived from the Plan 9 shell,
rc, and was influenced by functional programming languages, such as Scheme,
and the Tcl embeddable programming language.  This implementation is
derived from Byron Rakitzis's public domain implementation of rc.

Please see config.h for any conditional flags you may have to set on the
command line to make es compile.  The Makefile should just work; if it
doesn't, please let us know.  An ANSI C compiler is practically required.

For details on es, please see the man page.  For some background into our
motivation for writing es, see our Winter 1993 Usenix paper, ``Es: a
shell with higher-order functions,'' available by anonymous ftp as
	ftp.white.toronto.edu:/pub/es/usenix-w93.ps.Z
The paper corresponds very closely to the version of the shell included
here; see the file ERRATA for changes since the paper was published.

See the file CHANGES for recent changes to the shell.  See the file
TODO for what we still think we have left to do, and roughly what
time frame we expect to do it in.

Please report any problems to us at

There is a mailing list for discussing es.  Send mail to
	es-request@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu
to join the list.  The list itself is
