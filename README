This is the README file for es, version 0.79

For details on es, please see our Winter 1993 Usenix paper, ``Es: a shell
with higher-order functions,'' available by anonymous ftp as
	ftp.white.toronto.edu:/pub/es/usenix-w93.ps.Z
The paper corresponds very closely to the version of the shell included
here.  There should be a man page by now, but we've been remiss.  Consulting
the paper, initial.es, the source, and the mailing list (probably in that
order) is the best approximation we've got right now. 

See the file CHANGES for recent changes to the shell.  See the file TODO for
what we still think we have left to do, and roughly what time frame we
expect to do it in. 

Please see config.h for any conditional flags you may have to set on the
command like to make es compile.  The Makefile should just work; if it
doesn't, please let us know.

Please report any problems to haahr@adobe.com and byron@netapp.com. 

There is a mailing list for discussing es.  Send mail to
es-request@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu to join the list.  The list itself is
es@hawkwind.utcs.toronto.edu

Enjoy!
